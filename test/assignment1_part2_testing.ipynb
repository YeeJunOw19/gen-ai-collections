    "The nature of the 5 questions that I have tested out are \"latest news\" in nature. The runs with just using only the LLM models tend to produce generic answers or outdated answers . For example, in the questions about COVID variants and the Russia-Ukraine war, the LLM without context gives generic answers on things that have already happened in the past, but no more specific details about had happened between 2021 and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more specific style question where I was asking about a more specific event that had happened between 2021 and 2022, the LLM without context simply could not answer or it simply provided the wrong answer because it does not have the knowledge about the event at all. Take Elon Musk buying Twitter as an example, from the new dataset provided later on in RAG, we know that Elon Musk is in the negotiation phase in buying Twitter, but the vanilla LLM just has \"no\" as answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simple RAG pipeline and the RAG with HyDE pipeline performed similarly in my test. Both pipelines provide a form of context of what has happened recently pertaining to the question that I had posted, but HyDE first generates a hypothetical document from vanilla LLM, then uses that new question to perform similarity search. While questions where I was asking about updates on FIFA World Cup and Elon Musk buying Twitter did not produce more satisfying answers, they did provide a more up-to-date and rich answers to questions on COVID-19, Queen Elizabeth, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Now, these two pipelines are starting to pick up news and updates that had happened recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the previous two methods still lies within how my questions are formulated. My questions are formulated almost in the sense that I want the absolute latest news and updates of what is happening. So, not surprisingly, adding reranking into the RAG pipeline seems to produce the best results. Now, the LLM recognizes that Elon Musk is negotiating and made an offer to buy Twitter. It also recognizes that FIFA is facing some pressure from European soccer federations on human rights. Furthermore, it also picked up the fact that Omicron was the latest COVID-19 variant at the time, and that Queen Elizabeth has sadly passed away. Re-ranking takes similar vectors / news, and reranked them one more time based on a different and more refined method of similarity calculation."
