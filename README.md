# Generative AI Projects

This repository is part of a Generative AI class that I had attended at Northwestern University. Projects and assignments
from the class are formatted such that each subsequent assignment builds on top of the previous assignments. The folder
`readme_docs` contains all the README files for each assignment along with descriptions of the underlying code.

At a glance, this repository covers core GenAI functionalities and experimental techniques, including:
1. Vector Embeddings & Pinecone Integration
- Extraction and storage of semantic vector embeddings using popular transformer models.
- Efficient semantic search powered by Pinecone, a managed vector database.
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Fusion of LLMs with custom knowledge bases for more accurate and context-aware responses.
- Explores pipeline design and evaluation for hybrid search + generation systems. 
3. Prompt Engineering
- Hands-on experiments with zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.
- Demonstrates prompt optimization techniques for different downstream tasks.
4. LoRA Fine-Tuning
- Efficient fine-tuning of large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
- Includes walkthroughs on parameter-efficient learning strategies.
5. Agentic AI
- Exploration of autonomous, goal-driven agents using frameworks like LangChain Agents or Auto-GPT-like architectures.
- Task planning, tool usage, memory, and feedback loops.

Grateful to the instructors at Northwestern for designing such a hands-on and practical curriculum.
The course provided a strong foundation to explore not just the “how” but the “why” behind each method, 
and encouraged real-world application from day one.
